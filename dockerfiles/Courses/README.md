This is the Course docker file folder.  

Here has 3 kinds of courses, CV, DL, LLM. 
CV and DL are recommended to run on dGPUs, and LLM is suggested to run on 395.

Upon buiding, the scripts inside each folder will copy related notebooks from `projects`, download neccessary files,
and build then push the image.

Course images remain notebook and course focused. Browser coding environments are built from the separate generic code image line in `dockerfiles/Code/` as `auplc-code-cpu` and `auplc-code-gpu`; do not create per-course VS Code image variants such as course-specific code-server images.

Use the existing course target for course notebook images:

```bash
make -C dockerfiles courses GPU_TARGET=gfx1151
```

Use the code targets only for generic code-server environments:

```bash
make -C dockerfiles code-cpu
make -C dockerfiles code-gpu GPU_TARGET=gfx1151
make -C dockerfiles code
```
