# Ansible Playbooks

K3s cluster setup playbooks based on [k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible).

For the human SSH-preinstalled workflow, edit `inventory.yml` directly and use
the playbook commands in the [deployment guide](../README.md). Every server and
agent host entry defaults to unquoted `auplc_gpu_access_enabled: auto`. On each
host, `auto` uses Python 3 to scan `/sys/bus/pci/devices` for vendor `0x1002`
and PCI class `0x03*`; it has no `lspci` or `pciutils` dependency. A match
enables ROCm and the GPU access package, while a successful empty scan skips
both. A scan failure aborts before mutation, and `any_errors_fatal` stops the
play. Unquoted `true` and `false` force enablement or disablement and bypass
detection.

Pass `--inventory` to validate direct values of `auto`, `true`, or `false`. A
generated `--gpu-resolution` report is not required for the human workflow. If
supplied, it requires `--inventory`, and both generated artifacts must use
strict booleans. The deploy skill never generates `auto`.

The deploy skill has a separate generator-first SSH workflow that discovers GPU
hosts from managed-host evidence. PXE is always generator-based and uses only
`pxe.diskless_agents_have_amd_gpus` as its GPU policy input. See the
[skill scripts guide](../../skills/deploy-aup-learning-cloud/scripts/README.md)
for the complete generator-first skill command sequences.

The GPU access role installs AMD's `amdgpu-insecure-instinct-udev-rules`
package, pinned to `30.30.4.0-2341068.24.04`, on GPU hosts and GPU-enabled PXE
root filesystems. The package sets mode `0666` only on `/dev/kfd` and DRM
`renderD*` nodes. It does not change `card*` nodes, which retain normal system
policy, observed as `root:video 0660`.

Device-plugin allocation is a separate layer and remains the visibility
boundary for Pods requesting `amd.com/gpu`; it does not change host inode
permissions. AUPLC Hub adds no GPU supplemental group. No GPU group was needed
for the tested ROCm compute path.

## Prerequisites

- **Ansible**: 2.18.3+ (on controller node only)
- **Python**: 3.12
- **SSH**: Root login with key-based auth to all nodes
- **Hosts**: Consistent `/etc/hosts` entries across all nodes
- **GPU integration**: The infrastructure owner must deploy and maintain the AMD
  device plugin and ROCm node labeller outside AUPLC. Use the pinned manual
  installation in the [Kubernetes components guide](../k8s/README.md) when the
  cluster does not already provide them. Before Helm, run the readiness and
  capacity checks in the [deployment guide](../README.md).
