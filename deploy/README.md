- [Configuration Reference](https://amdresearch.github.io/aup-learning-cloud/jupyterhub/configuration-reference.html)

## Quick Start

### Single Node

```bash
cd ..
sudo ./auplc-installer install
```

### Multi-Node Cluster

For SSH-preinstalled nodes, edit the Ansible inventory and multi-node values
file directly. PXE remains generator-based because the controller inventory,
rootfs settings, runtime overlay, and GPU policy must be generated as one
consistent artifact set.

The AMD device plugin and ROCm node labeller are cluster infrastructure
prerequisites owned outside AUPLC. The infrastructure owner must deploy and
maintain them according to AMD's official guidance. If they are not installed,
follow the pinned manual installation commands in the
[Kubernetes components guide](k8s/README.md). Before Helm, verify that the
DaemonSets are ready and that GPU capacity is advertised.

#### SSH-preinstalled

Edit `deploy/ansible/inventory.yml` with the server and agent hostnames, IPs,
k3s token, and other site settings. Keep the human template default,
`auplc_gpu_access_enabled: auto`, unquoted on each host. `auto` runs Python 3 on
that host to scan `/sys/bus/pci/devices` for vendor `0x1002` devices whose PCI
class starts with `0x03`. It does not use `lspci` or require `pciutils`. A match
enables ROCm and the AMD GPU access package; a successful scan with no match
skips both. If a scan fails, the play aborts before either is changed, and
`any_errors_fatal` stops the play for all hosts.

Set an unquoted YAML boolean `true` or `false` only when you need to override
detection. `true` forces ROCm and package installation, while `false` forces
both to be skipped. Either boolean bypasses the scan. Don't quote any of these
values or use alternatives such as `yes` and `no`.

For example:

```yaml
k3s_cluster:
  children:
    server:
      hosts:
        controller-1:
          ansible_host: 192.0.2.10
          auplc_gpu_access_enabled: auto
    agent:
      hosts:
        gpu-worker-1:
          ansible_host: 192.0.2.11
          auplc_gpu_access_enabled: auto
```

Copy the human-maintained multi-node values example, then edit the copy for the
site's authentication, storage, images, accelerators, and network access:

```bash
cd ..
REPO_ROOT="$(pwd)"
DEPLOY_SCRIPTS="$REPO_ROOT/skills/deploy-aup-learning-cloud/scripts"
cp runtime/values-multi-nodes.yaml.example runtime/values-multi-nodes.yaml
# Edit deploy/ansible/inventory.yml and runtime/values-multi-nodes.yaml.

python3 "$DEPLOY_SCRIPTS/validate.py" --repo "$REPO_ROOT" --topology ssh-preinstalled \
  --inventory "$REPO_ROOT/deploy/ansible/inventory.yml" \
  --values "$REPO_ROOT/runtime/values.yaml" \
  --values "$REPO_ROOT/runtime/values-multi-nodes.yaml" \
  --helm-dry-run

cd "$REPO_ROOT/deploy/ansible"
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/pb-base.yml
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/pb-k3s-site.yml
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/pb-rocm.yml

kubectl rollout status -n kube-system daemonset/amdgpu-device-plugin-daemonset --timeout=5m
kubectl rollout status -n kube-system daemonset/amdgpu-labeller-daemonset --timeout=5m
kubectl get nodes -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,AMD_GPU:.status.allocatable.amd\.com/gpu'

cd "$REPO_ROOT"
helm upgrade --install jupyterhub ./runtime/chart \
  --namespace jupyterhub --create-namespace \
  -f runtime/values.yaml \
  -f runtime/values-multi-nodes.yaml
```

With `--inventory` alone, the validator accepts exactly one unquoted `auto`,
`true`, or `false` value for `auplc_gpu_access_enabled` on every managed host.
This validates the direct-edit workflow without a generated GPU resolution
report. `--gpu-resolution` may be supplied only with `--inventory`; that pair
is for generated artifacts, whose inventory values and resolution entries must
remain strict booleans. The generator never writes `auto`.

The installer, Ansible GPU access role, and PXE controller install AMD's
`amdgpu-insecure-instinct-udev-rules` package, pinned to version
`30.30.4.0-2341068.24.04`. Its package-owned rule sets mode `0666` only on
`/dev/kfd` and DRM `/dev/dri/renderD*` nodes. It does not match
`/dev/dri/card*`; card nodes retain the normal system policy, observed as
`root:video 0660`.

This host permission policy is separate from Kubernetes allocation. The AMD
device plugin remains the visibility boundary: only Pods that request
`amd.com/gpu` receive allocated GPU devices, and the plugin does not change
host inode ownership or mode. AUPLC Hub adds no GPU supplemental group. The
tested ROCm compute path needs none: on representative GPU nodes, `rocminfo` succeeded
as UID `12345` with only supplemental GID `100`, while card nodes remained
inaccessible at mode `0660`. The reported agents were `gfx1151` and `gfx1200`.

`singleuser.fsGid: 100` controls shared notebook storage ownership only. It is
not part of GPU access and must not be treated as a GPU group setting.

#### PXE-diskless

Create a fresh spec, set `topology` to `pxe-diskless`, fill the PXE network
fields, and set `pxe.diskless_agents_have_amd_gpus` explicitly. Diskless agent
hardware can't be inferred from the controller. Generation writes the canonical
inventory, controller vars, runtime overlay, and GPU resolution report directly.
These artifacts express the desired deployment inputs; their existence is not
proof that rootfs provisioning succeeded. Review and install them before running
the controller playbook, whose successful completion provisions the rootfs.

```bash
cd ..
REPO_ROOT="$(pwd)"
DEPLOY_SCRIPTS="$REPO_ROOT/skills/deploy-aup-learning-cloud/scripts"
python3 "$DEPLOY_SCRIPTS/gen_configs.py" --print-schema > spec.json
# Edit spec.json: choose pxe-diskless and fill the node, network, and PXE fields.
GENERATED_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/generated"

cd "$REPO_ROOT"
python3 "$DEPLOY_SCRIPTS/gen_configs.py" --spec spec.json --out-dir "$GENERATED_DIR"
install -m 0600 "$GENERATED_DIR/inventory.yml" "$REPO_ROOT/deploy/ansible/inventory.yml"
install -m 0644 "$GENERATED_DIR/values-basic-example.yaml" "$REPO_ROOT/runtime/values-basic-example.yaml"
python3 "$DEPLOY_SCRIPTS/validate.py" --repo "$REPO_ROOT" --topology pxe-diskless \

cd "$REPO_ROOT/deploy/ansible"
sudo ansible-playbook \
  -i "$GENERATED_DIR/inventory.yml" \
  playbooks/pb-pxe-controller.yml \
  -e @"$GENERATED_DIR/pb-pxe-controller.vars.yml"

kubectl rollout status -n kube-system daemonset/amdgpu-device-plugin-daemonset --timeout=5m
kubectl rollout status -n kube-system daemonset/amdgpu-labeller-daemonset --timeout=5m
kubectl get nodes -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,AMD_GPU:.status.allocatable.amd\.com/gpu'

cd "$REPO_ROOT"
helm upgrade --install jupyterhub ./runtime/chart \
  --namespace jupyterhub --create-namespace \
  -f runtime/values.yaml \
  -f runtime/values-basic-example.yaml
```

A fresh PXE rootfs receives the pinned AMD udev package during the controller
playbook. A retained rootfs is accepted only when that exact package version and
its unmodified package-owned rule are present, with no conflicting legacy GPU
rule. Rebuild or correct a retained rootfs separately if that safety check fails.

#### Generator discovery failures

| Error | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Host is unreachable | Restore passwordless root SSH to that inventory host, then regenerate. |
| `lspci` is missing or fails | Install `pciutils` on the reported host and rerun generation. |
| Host evidence is `UNKNOWN` or AMD GPU BDF probes disagree | Compare AMD display BDFs from `lspci` with vendor `0x1002` display-class devices under `/sys/bus/pci/devices`; fix missing or inconsistent PCI enumeration, then regenerate. |
| Retained PXE rootfs has the wrong AMD udev package version, a modified package rule, or a conflicting legacy GPU rule | Rebuild the rootfs, or correct the package state through a separate reviewed maintenance action before rerunning the playbook. |

## Deployment branch boundary

This branch and these instructions do not modify or roll out any live
deployment. Environment-specific deployment branches must backport the host
permission and immediate artifact publication changes before their own reviewed
rollout.
