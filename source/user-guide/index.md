## For Users

Start with [Platform Basics](platform-basics.md) for login, environment selection, storage, and server lifecycle. Then use [JupyterLab Guide](jupyterlab-guide.md) or [Code Server Guide](code-server-guide.md) depending on the environment you launch. For authentication details, see the [Authentication Guide](../jupyterhub/authentication-guide.md). Your administrator can provide the JupyterHub URL; once logged in you can:

- Launch notebook environments (Base CPU, GPU Base, CV/DL/LLM/PhySim courses)
- Use hardware acceleration options (CPU, GPU) as allowed for your account
- Manage your workspace and files in JupyterLab
- Stop your server when finished to free resources

Detailed end-user documentation may be expanded in future releases; contact your system administrator or see the repository for updates.
