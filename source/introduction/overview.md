## What is AUP Learning Cloud?

AUP Learning Cloud provides a multi-user Jupyter notebook environment optimized for AI and machine learning education on AMD hardware platforms.

## Key Features

### Hardware Acceleration

- **AMD GPU**: Leverage ROCm on AMD Ryzen™ AI iGPUs (Strix Halo, Strix) and AMD Radeon™ RDNA 4 discrete GPUs (RX 9070 XT, AI Pro R9700) for high-performance deep learning and AI workloads
- **AMD CPU**: Support for general-purpose CPU-based computations

### Flexible Deployment

Kubernetes provides a robust infrastructure for deploying and managing JupyterHub. We support both single-node and multi-node K3s cluster deployments, and produce offline install bundles for air-gapped environments.

### Custom URL Launcher

We provide a basic **ROCm + PyTorch** environment; you can clone your own Git repository into this environment at server start (via URL and branch or by selecting a repo from your GitHub account). Private repositories are supported via a GitHub App or a pre-configured default access token. Your code is then available in the workspace so you can run it immediately.

### Authentication

Seamless integration with GitHub Single Sign-On (SSO) and Native Authenticator for secure and efficient user authentication:

- **Auto-admin on install**: Initial admin created automatically with random password
- **Dual login**: GitHub OAuth + Native accounts on single login page
- **GitHub Teams → Groups sync**: GitHub team membership is mapped to JupyterHub groups for resource access control
- **Batch user management**: CSV/Excel-based bulk operations via scripts

### Admin Dashboard

A dedicated React-based admin dashboard (under `/hub/admin/`) provides user/group management and a live usage view — daily active users, active sessions (via Server-Sent Events), pending spawns, idle-session warnings, and course/accelerator usage breakdowns. Quotas can be applied and reset in batch.

### Observability

Optional Prometheus + Grafana integration exposes Hub and single-user metrics. Two preset Grafana dashboards ship with the chart (`grafana-dashboard-aup-hub-ops.json`, `grafana-dashboard-aup-hub-resources.json`).

### Storage Management and Security

Dynamic NFS provisioning ensures scalable and persistent storage for user data, while Traefik ingress with automated TLS certificate management guarantees secure and reliable communication.

## Learning Solutions

AUP Learning Cloud offers the following Learning Toolkits:

- **Computer Vision** - 10 hands-on labs covering common computer vision concepts and techniques
- **Deep Learning** - 12 hands-on labs covering common deep learning concepts and techniques
- **Large Language Model from Scratch** - 9 hands-on labs designed to teach LLM development from scratch
- **Physics Simulation** - Hands-on labs for physics simulation with GPU acceleration
